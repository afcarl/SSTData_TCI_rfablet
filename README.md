# DESCRIPTION
This Python code is an additional material of the publication "Data-driven Models for the Spatio-Temporal Interpolation of satellite-derived SST Fields", from **R. Fablet, P. Huynh Viet, R. Lguensat**, accepted for publication in *IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging*.
This code creates the SST interpolation dataset considered in the above paper. It creates a cloudy SST dataset using OSTIA SST data as groundtruthed data and METOP SST data as cloud masks.
